# <code>DSp2LinkedList</code> Linked List Project

For this assignment you will implement a linked list of integers.

This time we implement the list data structure using linked nodes instead of an array, a choice which has significant
implications for coding and also efficiency. There are also a few different variations on linked lists and the structure
of the node objects that make up the list. For this project we will implement a singly-linked list (so each node
"points" to the next node in the list). This makes the <code>addLast</code> method less efficient, and the
<code>addFirst</code> method much more efficient.

As another change to mix things up a bit, each element of our linked list will be a big-I <code>Integer</code>
(as opposed to a little-i <code>int</code>). With autoboxing, there is not **too** much difference. The main thing
is that an array of <code>Integer</code>s initializes every entry to <code>null</code>, so this project will also
have methods that throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. Again, you will likely want to add an instance field
to keep track of the size of the list.
